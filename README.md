<b>The main mandatory part</b>

PrivatBank's public API allows you to get information about the cash exchange rates of PrivatBank and the NBU on the selected date. The archive stores data for the last 4 years.

Write a console utility that returns PrivatBank's EUR and USD exchange rates for the last few days. Set a restriction that the utility can only display exchange rates for the last 10 days. Use the Aiohttp client to make a request to the API. Follow the SOLID principles when writing the assignment. Handle errors in network requests correctly.
